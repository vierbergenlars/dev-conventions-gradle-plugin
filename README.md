A gradle plugin that automatically applies conventions and/or opinions based on the plugins that are applied to your project.

## Installation

You can choose to apply only the development conventions, which are simple integrations between different plugins.

```groovy
plugins {
   id "be.vbgn.dev-conventions" version "0.1.0" // See https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/be.vbgn.dev-conventions for the latest version
}
```

You can also choose to apply the development opinions, which are *my* opinions about how some things should be configured.


```groovy
plugins {
   id "be.vbgn.dev-conventions.opinion" version "0.1.0" // See https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/be.vbgn.dev-conventions.opinion for the latest version
}
```

## What's in the package?

### Conventions

 * Integration between `jacoco` and `org.sonarqube` plugins: makes `sonarqube` task depend on all jacoco reports, and ensures that jacoco reports are generated in XML, for sonarqube to consume.
 * Integration between `org.sonarqube` and `be.vbgn.ci-detect` plugins: Configures sonarqube extension to have the right branch name or pull request information.

### Opinions

 * The `org.ajoberstar.reckon` plugin: Is configured with `scopeFromProp()` and `snapshotFromProp()`. Before a tag can be created with `reckonTagCreate`, the `check` task must complete succesfully.
 * The `jacoco` plugin: `jacocoTestReport` and `jacocoTestCoverageVerification` tasks contain execution data of *all* Test tasks in the project.
 * All `Test` tasks are configured in fail-fast mode when a CI environment is detected
